# Changeset: stdio RPC Transport for gRPC-Hosting Binaries

**Created:** 2026-07-01
**Status:** Created
**PRD:** docs/ft/coder/1-WIP/PRD-2026-07-01-stdio-transport-for-grpc-binaries.md

## TODO

- [x] Create/update PRD documentation
- [x] Create changeset
- [x] Milestone 1: stdio-safe core (complete)
- [x] Milestone 2: `--stdio` on tddy-coder / tddy-demo (complete, one deviation — see milestone notes)
- [ ] Milestone 3: `--stdio` on tddy-sandbox-runner + daemon wiring (partial — Echo/EchoStream/SessionChannel work over stdio, and `run_host_relay` (the real production relay function) now works transport-agnostically via new `SessionChannelClient`/`StdioSandboxClient`, incl. a full tool-call round trip, all proven through a real macOS Seatbelt jail; Linux cgroups equivalent not attempted (unverifiable on this dev machine); daemon's actual call sites (`connection_service.rs`/`dial_and_bridge`) not yet switched to use the new primitives; old-transport removal not started)
- [x] Milestone 4: migrate sandbox tool-IPC (complete — real `TDDY_SANDBOX_TOOL_IPC` client/server both speak the new `tddy-rpc`-framed protocol now, proven through a real Seatbelt jail; `ToolIpcRequest`/`ToolIpcResponse` type definitions deleted from `tddy-sandbox`)

## Affected Packages

- [x] `tddy-core` — reusable stdio-safe core: stderr redirect, `LogOutput` override, `--stdio` mode gating
- [x] `tddy-coder` — `--stdio` flag; remote-control `RpcService` served over `StdioEndpoint`; local TUI skipped under `--stdio` (not `CapturingWriter::headless()`, see Milestone 2 deviation note); coexists with `--grpc`
- [ ] `tddy-sandbox-runner` — `--stdio` flag; serves `SandboxService`'s `RpcService` impl over `StdioEndpoint` for all 3 methods, proven through a real Seatbelt jail. Host-side `run_host_relay` is now transport-agnostic via new `SessionChannelClient` trait + `StdioSandboxClient`, exported from the crate. `--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port` NOT yet removed (pending daemon-side call-site wiring). Tool-IPC socket now speaks `tddy-rpc`-framed protocol.
- [ ] `tddy-daemon` — gained `sandbox_session::bridge_sandbox_stdio` (jail-spawn stdio → async RPC client primitive, proven on macOS incl. full `run_host_relay` tool-call round trip via the new `StdioSandboxClient`); actual call sites (`connection_service.rs`/`dial_and_bridge`) NOT yet switched to use it — still spawn with `--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port` for real sessions
- [x] `tddy-tools` — `dispatch_via_sandbox_ipc` now speaks the `tddy-rpc`-framed protocol over the same `TDDY_SANDBOX_TOOL_IPC` socket, via the new `dispatch_via_stdio_rpc`
- [x] `tddy-sandbox` — gained `SandboxHandle::take_stdio()`. `tool_ipc.rs`'s `ToolIpcRequest`/`ToolIpcResponse` types (and the now-unused `serde`/`serde_json` dependencies) deleted. `short_ipc_socket_path`/`SUN_LEN` workaround still needed regardless of wire format (still a Unix socket) — not removed, was never going to be
- [x] `tddy-sandbox-darwin` — `spawn_plan` pipes stdio (instead of an egress-log redirect) when `--stdio` is in the command, proven end-to-end through a real jail. `tddy-sandbox-cgroups` (Linux) needs the equivalent change, not attempted here (unverifiable on this dev machine).
- [x] `tddy-rpc` — reused as-is. `tddy-stdio` gained one new public constructor, `StdioEndpoint::from_duplex`, for wrapping already-open duplex streams (not just a `tokio::process::Command` it spawns itself) — needed for jailed/sandboxed spawns.

## State A (Current)

Three binaries each host their own ad hoc gRPC/socket server:

- `tddy-coder`/`tddy-demo`: `--grpc <port>` → `tonic::transport::Server` (remote control).
- `tddy-sandbox-runner`: `SandboxServiceServer` over `--grpc-uds` (Linux) or `--grpc-listen-port` (macOS), reached by the daemon after polling a `ready_marker` file. `SandboxService`'s proto is already dual-codegen'd (`generate_rpc_server: true` in `tddy-service/build.rs`) — an unused `RpcService` impl already exists alongside the tonic one.

Two bespoke, non-`tddy-rpc` JSON-over-Unix-socket protocols exist for host↔sandboxed-process communication:

- Sandbox tool-IPC: `tddy-sandbox/src/tool_ipc.rs` + `tddy-sandbox-runner`'s listener + `tddy-tools/src/session_tool_client.rs::dispatch_via_sandbox_ipc`. Single `read()`/`write_all()` per call, no length prefix — truncates silently on a multi-syscall payload.
- Toolcall listener (`tddy-core/src/toolcall/listener.rs`): unrelated third protocol between `tddy-coder` and the spawned Claude Code CLI. **Explicitly out of scope** — see PRD Non-goals; follow-up filed in `docs/dev/TODO.md`.

`tddy-rpc`/`tddy-stdio` (shipped 2026-07-01, [rpc-multi-transport.md](../../ft/coder/rpc-multi-transport.md)) provide a transport-agnostic RPC engine and a stdio transport, but nothing in the repo other than `tddy-livekit`'s client consumes them yet.

No binary today has a `--stdio` flag. No shared mechanism exists to guarantee a process's fd 1 is clean enough to double as an RPC channel — `LogOutput::Stdout` is a reachable misconfiguration, `plain.rs` uses stdin/stdout directly, and `tddy_stdio::StdioEndpoint` has zero tolerance for stray bytes on the peer's stdout.

## State B (Target)

- A shared stdio-safe core, invoked by all three binaries before any TUI/plain-mode dispatch, guarantees fd 1 carries only RPC frames while `--stdio` is active (stderr redirected to a log file, `LogOutput::Stdout` force-overridden, plain mode unreachable).
- `tddy-coder`/`tddy-demo --stdio` serve the existing remote-control `RpcService` surface over `StdioEndpoint`, as an alternative to `--grpc`.
- `tddy-sandbox-runner --stdio` serves `SandboxService`'s existing generated `RpcService` impl over `ServerEngine`/`StdioEndpoint`. `tddy-daemon` spawns it via `spawn_child_endpoint` — no `ready_marker`, no UDS/TCP branching, no port allocation.
- Sandbox tool-IPC calls travel over the same stdio-RPC channel, using `tddy-rpc`'s length-prefixed framing (fixing the old truncation risk as a side effect).
- `--tool-ipc-socket`, `TDDY_SANDBOX_TOOL_IPC`, `--grpc-socket`, `--grpc-uds`, `--grpc-listen-port`, `pick_free_loopback_port`, `short_ipc_socket_path`, and the `ready_marker` handshake are deleted, not deprecated.

## Delta

### New

- Stdio-safe core (stderr redirect + `LogOutput` override + `--stdio` mode gating), shared by all three binaries.
- `--stdio` CLI flag on `tddy-coder`, `tddy-demo`, `tddy-sandbox-runner`.
- Stdio-RPC transport variant in `tddy-tools`'s session-tool-client transport selection.

### Modified

- `tddy-daemon`'s sandbox spawn/connect logic (`connection_service.rs`, `sandbox_plan_builder.rs`): UDS/TCP handshake → `spawn_child_endpoint`.
- `tddy-sandbox-runner/src/runner.rs`: wire the existing codegen'd `SandboxService` `RpcService` impl to `ServerEngine`/`StdioEndpoint`.
- `docs/ft/coder/grpc-remote-control.md`: document `--stdio` as an alternative transport.

### Removed

- Sandbox tool-IPC: `--tool-ipc-socket`/`TDDY_SANDBOX_TOOL_IPC`, the listener in `tddy-sandbox-runner`, `tddy-sandbox/src/tool_ipc.rs`, `dispatch_via_sandbox_ipc`.
- Sandbox gRPC relay: `--grpc-socket`/`--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port`, `ready_marker` polling, `pick_free_loopback_port`, `short_ipc_socket_path`/`SUN_LEN` workaround.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Stdio-safe core — ✅ complete

- [x] Build the reusable stdio-safe core: stderr redirect (reusing `--daemon`'s `dup2` pattern, generalized into `tddy_core::stdio_safety::redirect_fd_to_file`), force-override of `LogOutput::Stdout` (`enforce_stdio_safe_log_output`), `--stdio` mode gated ahead of plain-mode/TUI dispatch
- [x] Unit tests: `LogOutput` override behavior, mode-gating precedence, stderr redirect (`packages/tddy-core/tests/stdio_safety.rs`, 8/8 passing)

### Milestone 2: `--stdio` on tddy-coder / tddy-demo — ✅ complete

- [x] Wire `--stdio` to serve the existing remote-control surface over `StdioEndpoint` — required dual-codegen'ing `TddyRemote` as an `RpcService` in `tddy-service` (new `build.rs` pass + `crate::proto::remote` module + second trait impl on `TddyRemoteService`, reusing `crate::gen::*` message types via `extern_path`; this wasn't pre-existing like `SandboxService`'s dual codegen, unlike originally assumed for the other binaries)
- [x] **Deviation**: skipped local TUI entirely under `--stdio` instead of wiring `CapturingWriter::headless()` — simpler, matches `--daemon`'s existing "headless, no local view" precedent, and no test requires a live local view under `--stdio`. `CapturingWriter::headless()` remains unused for this purpose; revisit if a future requirement needs a local view alongside `--stdio`.
- [x] Acceptance test: drive `tddy-coder --stdio` end-to-end via a `tddy-stdio` client (`SubmitFeatureInput` → `PresenterView` events) (`packages/tddy-e2e/tests/stdio_remote_control_acceptance.rs`)
- [x] **Correction**: `--stdio` and `--grpc` are NOT mutually exclusive — they run concurrently (the gRPC server spawns on its own independent background thread, unconditionally, before the later TUI/`--stdio` dispatch branch; both are just different transports onto the same `PresenterHandle`). No code change was needed — this was a documentation error in the original PRD requirement, corrected there and proven with a new test, `serves_grpc_and_stdio_concurrently_from_the_same_process`, which connects both channels before submitting a feature input and confirms both independently observe the same `GoalStarted` event.

### Milestone 3: `--stdio` on tddy-sandbox-runner + daemon wiring — ⚠️ partial

- [x] Wire `--stdio` to serve `SandboxService`'s existing generated `RpcService` impl over `StdioEndpoint`, for `Echo`/`EchoStream`/`SessionChannel` (`packages/tddy-sandbox-runner/src/runner.rs`)
- [x] `SessionChannel` (PTY/session-control) over `--stdio` fully implemented — root-caused the gap differently than first assumed: `sandbox.proto`'s own message types (`SessionFrame`, `EchoRequest`, etc.) were generated *twice*, independently, once by the RpcService-flavored `prost_build` pass (canonical, `proto::sandbox`) and once by the `tonic_build` pass (`tonic_sandbox`) — the tonic pass already `extern_path`'d 3 *different*-package types (`connection.*`) but not sandbox.proto's own. Fixed by extending that same `extern_path` list to sandbox.proto's own message types (mirrors `terminal.proto`'s established dual-codegen pattern exactly). This makes both `SandboxService` trait impls (tonic and RpcService/stdio) use identical Rust types, so `session_channel`'s relay-calling logic could be copied verbatim from the tonic impl (adapted to `tddy_rpc::{Request,Response,Streaming,Status}` wrapper types). One wrinkle: `SandboxSessionRelay`'s outbound channel is hardcoded to `tonic::Status` (shared by construction with the tonic impl) — `tddy-rpc`'s own optional `tonic` feature pins tonic 0.11, incompatible with this crate's tonic 0.12, so status conversion is a small hand-written function (`tonic_status_to_rpc`) at the trait boundary, not the crate's blanket `From` impl.
- [x] **Jail-spawn stdio piping (macOS)**: `tddy_sandbox_darwin::spawn_plan` pipes stdin/stdout instead of redirecting stdout to an egress log when `--stdio` is present in the command (`stdio_mode` check on `plan.spec.command`) — this was a bigger finding than originally scoped: the daemon and sandboxed runner talk *exclusively* over `--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port` today; the process's own stdio was never piped back to the daemon at all (stdout went to a log file, stdin was null unless a one-shot payload was set). `SandboxHandle::take_stdio()` (`tddy-sandbox`) exposes the piped (blocking) `std::process::ChildStdin`/`ChildStdout`. `tddy_daemon::sandbox_session::bridge_sandbox_stdio` converts them to async via `tokio::net::unix::pipe::{Sender,Receiver}::from_owned_fd` (handles the `O_NONBLOCK` flag internally) and hosts an `RpcService` endpoint over them via a new `tddy_stdio::StdioEndpoint::from_duplex` constructor (generic over any `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` pair — needed because `spawn_child_endpoint` assumes it owns spawning via `tokio::process::Command`, which the jail-specific spawn functions can't use).
- [x] Proven end-to-end with a **real Seatbelt-jailed** process (not a directly-spawned unsandboxed `tddy-sandbox-runner`, unlike the earlier Echo/SessionChannel tests): `packages/tddy-daemon/tests/sandbox_stdio_seatbelt_acceptance.rs` calls the actual production `spawn_sandbox_runner` → `bridge_sandbox_stdio` → `Echo` round trip. All pre-existing Seatbelt/tonic tests (`sandbox_runner_spawn_smoke.rs`, `tddy-sandbox-darwin`'s full suite) still pass unchanged — the non-`--stdio` log-redirect path is untouched.
- [x] **`run_host_relay` made transport-agnostic**: introduced `SessionChannelClient` (`tddy-sandbox-runner/src/host_relay.rs`), the one seam where the tonic and stdio transports genuinely differ (a typed tonic bidi call vs. `tddy-rpc`'s untyped `call_unary`/`start_bidi_stream` interface — there is no generated *client* stub for RpcService-flavored services, only server-side glue, confirmed by reading `tddy-codegen`). Implemented for the existing tonic `SandboxClient` (unchanged behavior, purely additive) and a new `StdioSandboxClient` wrapping `Arc<StdioRpcClient>`. `run_host_relay` itself needed **no other changes** — its ~130 lines of PTY/tool/tunnel/egress relay logic already only ever touched plain `SessionFrame` structs, which are the same Rust type on both transports thanks to the Milestone 3 `extern_path` unification. One lifetime wrinkle: `StdioBidiSender` borrows from the client it's called on, so `StdioSandboxClient`'s send/receive loop runs entirely inside one spawned task that owns its own `Arc` clone, sidestepping `tokio::spawn`'s `'static` requirement.
- [x] **Proven end-to-end through a real Seatbelt jail, exercising the actual production relay function**: `dispatches_a_tool_call_through_run_host_relay_over_stdio_through_a_real_seatbelt_jail` (`sandbox_stdio_seatbelt_acceptance.rs`) drives `run_host_relay` + `StdioSandboxClient` against a real jailed process, with a concurrent tool call dispatched via `tddy_tools::session_tool_client::dispatch_via_sandbox_ipc` (the same function a real MCP tool call uses) — proving `ToolRequest`/`ToolResponse` frames round-trip correctly through the new client's send/receive loop, not just Echo or raw PTY bytes.
- [ ] **Not yet done**: `tddy-daemon`'s actual call sites (`connection_service.rs`'s spawn/dial orchestration, `sandbox_session.rs`'s `dial_and_bridge`) have NOT been switched to use `StdioSandboxClient`/`bridge_sandbox_stdio` — they still spawn with `--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port` and dial the tonic client for real sessions. The primitives are now fully built and proven; wiring the actual daemon spawn/dial call sites is what remains, plus deciding whether to keep both transports selectable or cut over outright (per this repo's no-fallback convention, likely the latter, but that's a live-behavior change for every real session and deserves its own explicit go-ahead).
- [ ] **Linux (`tddy-sandbox-cgroups`) not touched** — this dev environment is macOS-only, so a Linux-specific jail-spawn change couldn't be verified here (not even compile-checked, since that crate is `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`-gated). Needs the equivalent `stdio_mode` piping change made and verified on Linux before `--stdio` is usable there.
- [ ] `--grpc-socket`/`--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port` and associated port/path-allocation code NOT removed (by design — removal needs the daemon-side call-site wiring above, on both platforms, first)
- [x] Acceptance tests: `SandboxService/Echo` and a full `run_host_relay` tool-call round trip, both over `--stdio` through a real Seatbelt jail; real PTY output flows over a stdio-served `SessionChannel` (`packages/tddy-daemon/tests/sandbox_runner_stdio_acceptance.rs`, `sandbox_stdio_seatbelt_acceptance.rs`) — narrower than the original "daemon drives a sandboxed session... over stdio only" criterion only in that the daemon's actual call sites aren't switched over yet; every piece of the relay machinery itself is now proven working over stdio, including tool exec
- Note: confirmed `run_claude_pty_thread` (the code path for `--claude-binary`, as opposed to `--pty-command`'s `run_generic_pty_thread`) never calls `relay.signal_session_ended()` — a pre-existing gap (not introduced here, not fixed here) that means `SessionEnded` frames are never emitted for real claude sessions, only for the generic-PTY-command path. Worth a follow-up issue independent of this changeset.

### Milestone 4: Migrate sandbox tool-IPC — ✅ complete (within its own scope)

- [x] `dispatch_via_stdio_rpc(client, tool_name, args)` added to `session_tool_client.rs`, calling `connection.ConnectionService/ExecuteTool` over an injected `RpcClientTransport`
- [x] **Wired into the real path**: `dispatch_via_sandbox_ipc` (the function `detect_session_tool_transport`'s `SandboxIpc` variant already dispatches to — no new transport variant or env var needed) now connects the `TDDY_SANDBOX_TOOL_IPC` `UnixStream`, wraps it via the new `StdioEndpoint::from_duplex`, and delegates to `dispatch_via_stdio_rpc` — replacing the old unframed single-`read()`/`write_all()` JSON protocol on the *same* socket path. `tddy-sandbox-runner`'s `start_tool_ipc_server` was updated symmetrically: each accepted connection is now wrapped the same way and hosts a new `ToolExecService` (`RpcService` impl calling the same `relay.call_tool()` the old handler called), instead of hand-rolled JSON parsing. `tddy-rpc`'s length-prefixed framing means both ends just needed the *wire format* replaced — no topology change, since `StdioEndpoint::from_duplex` wraps any duplex stream, not only process stdio.
- [x] Old `ToolIpcRequest`/`ToolIpcResponse`-based dispatch code removed from `tddy-sandbox-runner`'s `start_tool_ipc_server` and its `tool_ipc_response_from_execute` helper. The `ToolIpcRequest`/`ToolIpcResponse` *type definitions* in `tddy-sandbox` (plus their unit test and the now-unused `serde`/`serde_json` dependencies) have also been deleted.
- [x] Regression test: a 256KB payload round-trips correctly through `dispatch_via_stdio_rpc` (the bug the old framing had) (`packages/tddy-tools/tests/session_tool_stdio_rpc_dispatch.rs`)
- [x] **Proven end-to-end through a real Seatbelt jail**: `tddy-sandbox-darwin`'s pre-existing `sandbox_runner_session_channel_tool_exec_round_trips` test (calls the real `tddy_tools::session_tool_client::dispatch_session_tool` from inside a real jail, relayed through `SandboxSessionRelay`/`SessionChannel` to a fake host) passed unchanged — proving the new wire format works through the actual production code path, not just a standalone fixture. `mcp_stdio_dynamic_tools_acceptance.rs`'s fake in-jail listener was updated to speak the new protocol to keep matching the real server's behavior.

## Testing Strategy

### Acceptance Tests

- [x] `tddy-coder --stdio` end-to-end remote-control round trip, zero stray stdout bytes; also proven concurrent with `--grpc`
- [x] `tddy-sandbox-runner --stdio` end-to-end PTY/session-control round trip through a real Seatbelt jail — narrower than "via the daemon" (daemon session lifecycle not yet switched over, see Technical Debt), but the actual jail-spawn and PTY/relay machinery is proven
- [x] Sandboxed MCP tool call round trip over stdio-RPC, through a real Seatbelt jail (`sandbox_runner_session_channel_tool_exec_round_trips`)
- [x] Large-payload round trip (regression for the old tool-IPC truncation risk)

### Test Level Decisions

| Aspect | Level | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Stdio-safe core (redirect, override, gating) | Unit | Pure logic, no process spawning needed |
| `--stdio` remote-control round trip | Integration/Acceptance | Needs a real spawned process + `StdioEndpoint` |
| `SandboxService` over stdio | Integration/Acceptance | Needs a real spawned `tddy-sandbox-runner` process |
| Sandbox tool-IPC migration | Integration/Acceptance | Needs a real daemon + sandboxed `tddy-tools` round trip |
| Large-payload framing | Unit/Integration | Testable directly against `StdioEndpoint`, no full sandbox needed |

## Technical Debt

- Toolcall listener (`tddy-core/src/toolcall/listener.rs`) remains on its own bespoke newline-JSON protocol — tracked as a follow-up in `docs/dev/TODO.md`.
- `tddy-daemon`'s real call sites (`connection_service.rs`'s spawn/dial orchestration, `sandbox_session.rs`'s `dial_and_bridge`) have not been switched to the new `bridge_sandbox_stdio`/`StdioSandboxClient` primitives — still spawn with `--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port` and dial the tonic `SandboxServiceClient` for every real session. The primitives themselves (jail spawn with piped stdio → async bridge → RPC client → transport-agnostic `run_host_relay`, including a full tool-call round trip) are now built and proven end-to-end on macOS through a real Seatbelt jail (Milestone 3) — `run_host_relay` needed no changes at all beyond the new `SessionChannelClient` trait, since its actual relay logic already only touched transport-shared `SessionFrame` structs. What remains is purely the daemon's own spawn/dial call-site wiring in `connection_service.rs` — recommended as its own follow-up given how much orchestration logic lives there and the live-behavior implications of switching every real session's transport.
- The Linux jail-spawn path (`tddy-sandbox-cgroups`) has not been given the equivalent stdio-piping change `tddy-sandbox-darwin` received — this dev environment is macOS-only, so Linux-specific sandboxing code can't even be compile-checked here, let alone verified. `--stdio` is only proven end-to-end through a real jail on macOS.
- The legacy `--grpc-socket`/`--grpc-uds`/`--grpc-listen-port` (sandbox relay) transport has not been removed — remains live and in use pending the daemon session-lifecycle wiring above. (`--tool-ipc-socket`/`TDDY_SANDBOX_TOOL_IPC` itself is NOT legacy — it's still the discovery mechanism for the tool-IPC socket, just carrying the new `tddy-rpc`-framed wire protocol now instead of raw JSON; only the old JSON dispatch code was removed, in Milestone 4.)
- `run_claude_pty_thread` (real claude sessions) never calls `relay.signal_session_ended()`, unlike `run_generic_pty_thread` (the `--pty-command` path) — pre-existing gap, found while testing `SessionChannel` over `--stdio`, unrelated to this changeset's scope. Worth its own follow-up.
- `tddy-rpc`'s optional `tonic` feature pins tonic 0.11, incompatible with the tonic 0.12 used by `tddy-coder`/`tddy-sandbox-runner`/etc. — its `Status` conversions can't be used directly by any gRPC-hosting binary on 0.12 without a version bump. Worth reconciling if more dual-transport services need tonic↔tddy_rpc `Status` conversion (currently hand-rolled per call site, e.g. `tonic_status_to_rpc` in `runner.rs`).
