## Future Enhancements

### tddy-build (source: tddy-build-bazel-system changeset, 2026-06-16)

- **Distributed cache / parent-fallback** — remote shared cache layer (maker-build pattern). Deferred to v2.
- **Hermetic sandboxing** — isolate action execution; v1 uses PATH + cwd discipline only.
- **Full remote build execution** — `TDDY_SOCKET` relay covers co-located sessions; true remote/distributed build deferred.
- **Watch mode** — incremental rebuild on file change.
- **Output-publication convention** — finalize the published-artifact layout (maker-build publishes to `dist/{name}/`); v1 stages under `.tddy-build/out/{target_id}/` only.
- **Cross-compilation architecture filter** — port `ensure_action_architecture()` from `session_actions` for ToolTargets that ship per-arch binaries.
